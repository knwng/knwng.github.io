My name is Qian Wang, but you can call me Kyle. I'm a software engineer, focusing on developing high-performance deep learning infrastructures. 

After earning my bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, I spent several years working as a software engineer in Beijing.

Then I moved to the US to take a graduate program at UCLA, from which I will graduate in 2024.
