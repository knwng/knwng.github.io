My name is Qian Wang (pronounced “Chien Wong”), but you can call me Kyle.

I’m a software engineer at AMD in San Jose, specializing in the development of high-performance deep learning compilers and runtimes. Currently, I contribute to the Triton language, MLIR, LLVM, and PyTorch.

After earning my bachelor’s degree from Tsinghua University, I worked as a software engineer in Beijing for several years. Later, I moved to the United States and completed my master’s degree in 2024.
